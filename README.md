Software Engineering of Real-Time Systems FA2019: Music Player Project

This project uses the Keil IDE and Visual Basic to create a digital music player.

The user plugs a USB device into an STM32F405xx development board, then uses the Visual Basic user interface to communicate between the computer and the board.

Most of the code in Base_Project was pre-written by the professor to initialize the development board. The code I personally wrote is in MusicPlayer.c and Thread.c.
